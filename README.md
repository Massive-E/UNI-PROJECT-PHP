# UNI-PROJECT-PHP
This is the term project that I did in my 5th semester for a web developement course. 

Techonologies used are PHP, JavaScript, MAMP  HTML. 

It is a demonstration of my skills rather than a super polished project and  is fully functional.  

It is a simple tile conquering game; You choose a team and signup, click on tiles until you win. 
It is designed to run on a single computer, so run it through different browsers when playing with different players. 
It has chat features that shows what others are commenting, that updates shortly.

Other features include showing where players are currently, number of players 'online'  and total tiles per team.
